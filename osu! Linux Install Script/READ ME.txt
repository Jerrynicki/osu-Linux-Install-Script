Please check if you have Wine, Winetricks, Python3 and Wget installed. This install script will not work without them.

If you already have something installed under $HOME/osu_wine or $HOME/osu_dir, please back it up elsewhere, since the script will delete those directories.

To start with the installation, type "sh osu_install.sh" in your terminal while in this directory.

The installer will automatically create an osu!.desktop file in your home directory. You can use it to start osu! after it has been installed.

The installer will also create a symlink in $HOME/osu_dir, which you can use to easily access your osu! installation.


For a rhythm game like osu!, it's important to have low audio latency. You can find more information in the "low latency pulse" directory.
